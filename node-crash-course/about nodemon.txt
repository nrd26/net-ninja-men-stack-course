if you use node, every time you make changes to your code,
you'll have to exit the current process and restart the server
But with nodemon, the moment you save your changes
(ie: Ctrl+S), it automatically restarts your server
for you
To install:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon
Note: you have already installed it globally
(node install -g nodemon) in your laptop which means 
that you can use nodemon throughout different 
projects now after installing it once

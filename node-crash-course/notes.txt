If you want to share the code with other people, you can easily do it through GitHub or something but the node_modules
folder will be huge. So what we do is, we don't upload the node_modules folder instead, send the folder without node_modules.
The other person can just use the package.json file where all the dependencies are already there. Once in the path of the folder,
run npm install and it installs all necessary libraries.
